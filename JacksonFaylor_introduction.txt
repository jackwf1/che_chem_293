M.S. Chemical Engineering

Researching bio-energy with carbon caputure and sequestration process.

I am in this class for two reasons: 
First, this was the only elective that fit in my schedule. 
Second, while my emphasis was in physical chemistry and renewable energy/carbon capture, I have also taken biochem and am very intrigued by biochemical engineering.
