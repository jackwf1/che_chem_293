What does the model achieve?
The model shows that there is a linear relationship between the number of apples eaten in a week and yearly doctor's office trips needed.

How should metrics be interpreted?
Slope is the relationship between apples eaten and number of trups to the doctor's office.

What are appropriate use cases?
To determine if there is a linear correlation between the two data sets.

How is it implemented? *
A linear regression is achieved by determining a line of best fit for the data sets. This is done by minimizing residuals.

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
The concern is that it does not consider extended values on the x or y axises. Also, since someone cannot have negative apples per week or negative doctor's office visits per week, the linear regression is bound by these constraints.

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
The r square value of 0.9931 and P value of less than 0.0001 show that the linear slope of -1.417 was a good fit.
The x intercept of 7 shows that an apple a day does keep the doctor away.
